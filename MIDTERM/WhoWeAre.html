    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <p class="note">The Young University Squad was founded in 2014 by Yolanda Brannon, a Multimedia Arts and Journalism student at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. </p>

    <p class="note">Young US is a group of creative and efficient design college students with 3 years of experience in corporate art direction, design, and branding.  We work as a team to bring successful projects from concept to completion to market on time. </p>

    <p class="note">We have designed websites, logos, and magazine articles for various companies like Pinkas Partners, Owen Operations, Esquirol & Co. and much more. </p>

    <p class="note">Our goal is to create clean, fun designs that keep people of all ages entertained. We are geared to attract a younger crowd but not limited to the 30 plus club or senior citizens.</p>
