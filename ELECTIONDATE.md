Poll Locations

https://nyc.pollsitelocator.com/search

This Poll Site Locator Tool not only tells you where your polling location is based on your address, but it also shows you your local, state and national districts.

Remember to write down your Election/Assembly District number. Often poll locations will serve more than one district so you will need to know which distric you are so that you can go to the right table in the polling location.

If you cannot make it to the polls, visit this site for information about how to cast an absentee ballot.
